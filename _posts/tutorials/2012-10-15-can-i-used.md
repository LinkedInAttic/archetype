## What's this all about?

[Compass](http://compass-style.org/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) have changed the way many develop their front-end stack.
These frameworks themselves are rapidly evolving thanks to all the community support behind them and fantastic dedication, insight, and support from their maintainers.

For small and medium sized environments where the latest versions of these frameworks can be picked up and integrated quickly, this rapid iteration is a welcome bonus.

For large scale applications where thousands of pages and hundreds of CSS files need to be QA'd and tested, the upgrade path can be a bit slower.
For frameworks, like Archetype, that are built on top of Compass and Sass, this get's even trickier, where we don't know which version of the framework is running in any given environment.
Sure, we could easily enforce a required version in the `gemspec`, but we want to play nicely with everyone. Upgrade your frameworks when you're ready to, not because you were forced to.

## Version detection

To help address this, Archetype provides a version detection method to help bridge the gaps between different versions of frameworks.

{% highlight css %}
archetype-version()
{% endhighlight %}

### How does it work?

The simplest form of the version method isn't all that interesting, but can be useful for debugging. It just returns a string of the current version of the framework:
{% highlight css %}
@debug "running Archetype v#{archetype-version()}"
// running Archetype v0.0.1

@debug "running Compass v#{archetype-version(compass)}"
// running Compass v0.12.2
{% endhighlight %}

Now, to do something actually useful with it. Let's say, we're building a framework, and we want to take advantage of Sass' new `@content` blocks.

{% highlight css %}
// outputs a color and background color
// optionally outputs the `@content` block
@mixin colorful($color: blue, $background-color: pink) {
  color: $color;
  background-color: $background-color;
  @content;
}
{% endhighlight %}

If you were to run this on an older version of Sass less than 3.2, you'd have undesired behaviors. To ensure we only output `@content` where it will work, let's put it in a conditional that checks the version.
The `archetype-version()` method takes a string as a parameter. This string can contain a framework name (e.g. Archetype, Sass, Compass), a version to compare to and a condition (`<`, `<=`, `==`, `>`, `!=`, etc).

{% highlight css %}
// outputs a color and background color
// optionally outputs the @content block
@mixin colorful($color: blue, $background-color: pink) {
  color: $color;
  background-color: $background-color;
  @if archetype-version('Sass >= 3.2') {
    @content;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This will now _only_ execute the block if the version of Sass supports it.

This is also useful if you need to shim in functionality, or overload framework methods, say, for example, keyframe animations, which aren't supported in Compass 0.12.x.

## The future

Right now, this is a very primitive method. It works for us, for now. But as we all know, version detection is bad, and feature detection is good.
We're considering provide a feature detection method, something like `archetype-supports(content-block)`. This would let us abstract all the logic from the developer and not have to worry about looking up CHANGELOGs and the like.
