Components
----------
(all of them!)



modifiers vs contexts
- modifiers describe different types of a component (e.g. small, large, premium, first, last, persistent)
- contexts define how a component looks inside of something else (e.g. "in a toolbar", "in a container")

primitives
- what are they, where do i find them
- naming conventions? (is this too low level for this talk?)

selectors vs states
- examples
- what do states give you for free?
- complex states

mixins inside of components
- adding new mixins to styleguide parser
