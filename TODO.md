# TODO

## add default img assets

- loading spinners
- hovercard tip
- icons

## testing

- bsingh is lead
- more integration testing
- unit tests, for ruby functionality
- verify everything in trunk is passing and working as expected

## rubyize more functions

- known
  - triangle helper functions
  - ALL remaining list functions (some of these may require a refactor)
  - rtl()
- potential
  - grid functions
  - sprite wrapper functions (these don't really do anything special, so there isn't really any benefit from rewriting in ruby)
